# Spam-Filtering-using-Machine-Learning


Spam Detection is the process of detecting unwanted, malicious and virus infectedand helps to separate them from the nonspam texts. It uses a binary type of classification containing the labels such as ‘ham’ (nonspam) and spam. Application of this can be seen in Google Mail (GMAIL) where it segregates the spam emails in order to prevent them from getting into the user’s inbox.


In this Simple Machine Learning Spam Filtering project, we will develop a Spam Detector app using Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique for classification and Natural Language Processing. We will detect whether the piece of input text is “nonspam” or “spam”. We will split our dataset into training and testing and then train our classifier with SVM classifier.
