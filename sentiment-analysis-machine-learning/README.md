# Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment analysis serves as a fundamental aspect of dealing with customers on online portals and websites for the companies. It helps the company to classify a comment as a query, complaint, suggestion, opinion, like for a product. This way the companies can sgregate the comments or questions and prioritize what they need to handle first. Also companies try to delete content that has a negative sentiment attached to it. Altogether, it becomes easy for companies to understand public opinion.

Sentiment Analysis is based on Natural Language Processing which is the superclass of Sentiment Analysis which has the capacity to understand all kinds of things from a piece of text.

For this project I have used International Movie Database(IMDb) reviews for 50,000 reviews as the dataset which further facilitates 25000 samples for training and 25000 for testing.
