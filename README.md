1. Alarm Clock (alarm-clock-python.ipynb)
An interactive Jupyter Notebook that allows you to set an alarm clock using Python. It showcases the use of time-related libraries and basic GUI elements for setting alarms.

2. Credit Card Fraud Detection (credit-card-fraud-detection-python.py)
A Python script for detecting credit card fraud using machine learning algorithms. This project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and the implementation of classification models to identify fraudulent transactions.

3. Stone Paper Scissors Game (game-stone-paper-scissors-python.ipynb)
A fun implementation of the classic "Stone Paper Scissors" game in a Jupyter Notebook. This project demonstrates the use of randomization and basic user interaction in Python.

4. Handwriting Recognition (handwriting-recognition-machine-learning/)
A comprehensive machine learning project for recognizing handwritten digits. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using popular machine learning frameworks. All relevant code and models are contained in this directory.

5. Random Paragraph Generator (random-paragraph-generator-python.ipynb)
This Jupyter Notebook generates random paragraphs using predefined words and sentence structures. It showcases the use of randomization and string manipulation techniques in Python.

6. Random Password Generator (random-password-generator-python.ipynb)
A Jupyter Notebook that generates secure random passwords. It allows customization of password length and the inclusion of special characters, numbers, and letters, demonstrating string manipulation and randomization in Python.

7. Segregate Email Username from Domain (segregate-email-username-from-domain-python.ipynb)
A Jupyter Notebook for extracting and segregating usernames and domains from email addresses. This project illustrates the use of regular expressions and string operations in Python.
